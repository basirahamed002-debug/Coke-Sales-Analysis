🥤 Coca-Cola Sales & Profitability Analysis (2021)
📌 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Coca-Cola's sales performance and profitability across various retailers and regions in the United States. The goal was to identify key drivers of revenue, assess regional efficiency, and detect seasonal trends to help optimize business decisions.

The dataset includes thousands of transactional records featuring retail locations, product brands (Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, etc.), units sold, and operating margins.

🛠️ Data Transformation & Cleaning
Before performing the analysis, I conducted extensive data cleaning in Excel to ensure accuracy:

Currency Formatting: Converted sales and profit strings into numeric values for calculation.

Date Standardization: Transformed invoice dates into standard formats to enable time-series analysis.

New Columns Created:

Year, Month, and Quarter for seasonal trend detection.

Day of Week to identify peak shopping days.

Cleaned Operating Margin for accurate profitability benchmarking.

📊 Key Analysis Modules
1. Sales & Profitability Analysis
Retailer Performance: Analyzed unit sales, revenue, and profit across top retailers (e.g., Sodapop, BevCo).

Price Influence: Compared Price per Unit against Total Sales to observe price elasticity and volume trends.

Operating Margin Benchmarking: Identified the most profitable locations by comparing operating margins across different Cities and States.

2. Time-Based Analysis
Monthly Sales Trends: Aggregated sales data by month to observe performance throughout the fiscal year.

Seasonality: Detected peak sales periods (e.g., Q3 Summer demand) to assist in inventory and marketing planning.

Profitability Over Time: Tracked fluctuations in operating profit margins to identify periods of high efficiency.
